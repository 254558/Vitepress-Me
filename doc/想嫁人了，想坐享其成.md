# 想嫁人了，想坐享其成，不想奋斗，我有错吗？  

I want to get married, enjoy the fruits of others' labor and don't want to struggle. Am I wrong?  


……我发现了一个问题。  
... I've found a problem.

就是，凡是想走雌竞靠男人吃饭的女生，总是认为最大的困难在于“我要下定决心靠男人吃饭了”。  
That is, any girl who wants to rely on men through female competition always thinks that the biggest difficulty lies in "I have to make up my mind to rely on men for a living."

或嫁人，或包养，甚至更低端的直接出卖肉体。  
Either get married, be kept, or even more extremely, directly sell one's body.

仿佛道德问题是这类想法的最大阻碍。  
It seems that the moral issue is the biggest obstacle to such ideas.

只要冲破了自己的心理底线，那么一切都不是问题。  
As long as one breaks through one's psychological bottom line, then everything will be fine.

但，先不说最低端的出卖肉体，就说想嫁人靠男人这个想法，百分百的女生在成长过程中都会浮起这个念头。  
However, leaving aside the most low - end act of selling one's body, just talking about the idea of getting married and relying on a man, 100% of girls will have this thought during their growth.

就算最独立最能赚钱的女孩子，在加班累了的时候，在有钱男生真诚的付出好感时，在男朋友站在烟雾缭绕的厨房给你做宵夜时，也很难不这么想一想。  
Even the most independent and money - making girls, when they are tired from overtime work, when a rich boy shows sincere affection, or when a boyfriend cooks you a midnight snack in a smoky kitchen, it's hard not to think about it.

问题的关键，不在于错不错。  
The key to the problem is not whether it's wrong or not.

即便拿出卖肉体来说，问题的关键也不在于道德。  
Even when it comes to selling one's body, the key to the problem is not morality.

关键是什么呢。  
So what is the key?

甚至都不是风险与收益，而是你的能力。  
It's not even about risk and return, but your ability.

坐享其成，你肯定不是想过那种“家庭主妇”——一个月两三千生活费你和孩子以及老公一起花的日子。  
If you want to enjoy the fruits of others' labor, surely you don't want to live the life of a "housewife" - living on two or three thousand yuan a month for you, your children and your husband.

你最少最少，也想通过婚姻获得每月6000自由支配的金钱，而且最好，家务少于本地保姆的平均工作量。  
At the very least, you want to get 6,000 yuan a month for your own free use through marriage, and it would be best if the housework is less than the average workload of local nannies.

赤裸的说，嫁人也是一份工作。而娶你的那个，是你的老板。  
Frankly speaking, getting married is also a job. And the man who marries you is your boss.

长话短说，你可以看看中国男性平均薪资是多少，中位数是多少，你所在的城市男性收入水平是多少。  
To make a long story short, you can check what the average salary of Chinese men is, what the median is, and what the income level of men in your city is.

除了男生吃喝拉撒玩的必要开支，还有他还房贷车贷，必要的储蓄之外，每个月他还能自由支配的金钱有多少。  
After deducting a man's necessary expenses for food, drink, daily life, entertainment, as well as his mortgage, car loan payments and necessary savings, how much money does he have left for free use each month?

这部分自由支配的金钱才是他可能付出给妻子的金钱。  
This part of the money for free use is the money he might give to his wife.

另外还有个支付意愿问题。  
There is also the issue of willingness to pay.

他有，不代表他愿意给你。  
Just because he has it doesn't mean he's willing to give it to you.

你要算过上面那笔帐，就知道如果想每月得6000零花钱，就得找月薪在两万以上的男生。  
If you calculate the above accounts, you'll know that if you want to get 6,000 yuan in pocket money per month, you have to find a boy with a monthly salary of over 20,000 yuan.

这类男生，如无重大缺陷，在相亲市场上还是相对抢手的。  
Such boys, without major flaws, are relatively popular in the blind - date market.

对月薪在3000到5000的非体制内，非重点大学毕业，非大美女的女生还是能秒的。  
They can easily outcompete girls with a monthly salary of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, who are not from the public sector, not graduates of key universities, and not great beauties.

所以这就归结到你的能力了。  
So it all boils down to your ability.

别跟我说你有情绪价值，能说有的大部分都没有。  
Don't tell me you have emotional value. Most of those who claim to have it actually don't.

所以，总而言之，你去试试，你去真实的去找找，把时间精力都浪费在内耗上，不如真的尝试下，你就知道能不能行了。  
So, all in all, go and give it a try. Go and really look for it. Instead of wasting time and energy on self - consumption, it's better to actually try it, and then you'll know if it's possible.

——然后你会发现还不如回来打工。  
——And then you'll find that it's better to come back and work.
