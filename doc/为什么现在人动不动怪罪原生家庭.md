# 为什么现在人动不动怪罪原生家庭？
Why do people nowadays tend to blame their original families at every turn?


## 怪罪原生家庭不是应该的？
Isn't it reasonable to blame the original family?

绝大多数的原生家庭把你生出来，也不是为了你好。  
The vast majority of original families don't give birth to you for your own good.  

理由千奇百怪，有为了给自己养老，是兜底用的。  
The reasons are various. Some do it to ensure their own old-age care, as a kind of backup.  

有的爽了一把，也没有什么想法，有了就生。  
Some just have a moment of pleasure without any thought and give birth once they get pregnant.  

有的是想要捆绑对方，就要一个孩子，基本都是一些自私自利的行为。  
Some want to tie the other person down and thus have a child. These are basically self-centered behaviors.  


## 极端自私的原生家庭
还有的邪恶至极的原生家庭，这些原生家庭就是趴在子女身上的吸血鬼，生个三四个以上，养蛊一样，有一个有出息了，未来就有保障了，它们也不管你的未来会怎么样，是不是会被生活怎么折磨，会受多少罪。  
There are also extremely evil original families. These families are like vampires sucking on their children. They have three or more children, treating them like in a cruel survival-of-the-fittest situation. As long as one of them becomes successful, they think their future is secured, regardless of how their children's futures will be, how much they will be tortured by life, or how much suffering they will endure.  

**对于这样的家庭，有机会就一定要逃离**，否则就一辈子被吸血，永远不得解脱。  
For such evil original families, one must escape if there is a chance, otherwise, they will be sucked dry for a lifetime and never get freed.  


## 生育行为的本质
也只有少部分的家庭会站在孩子的角度，根据自己的家庭环境、社会环境和经济条件等理性思考，最终下决定。  
Only a small number of families will rationally consider from the child's perspective based on their family environment, social environment, economic conditions, etc., and finally make a decision.  

可是**全部从本质上**，家庭生小孩都是源于个人自私自利的行为。  
However, essentially, having children in all families stems from self-centered behaviors.  


## 生存的困境与根源
尤其是这片土地，无论物质还是精神基本没有什么福利兜底的，注定了过得极度辛苦。  
Especially in this place, there is basically no material or spiritual welfare support. Life is destined to be extremely hard.  

人所需要经历的生老病死、喜怒哀乐，可以说人这辈子痛苦是常态。  
There are also the inevitable experiences of birth, aging, illness, death, joys and sorrows. It can be said that pain is the norm in one's life.  

那么，这些归根结底是哪个带来的？根子在原生家庭。  
So, what ultimately brings all these? The root lies in the original family.  

原生家庭是造就这一切的根源。  
The original family is the root cause of all this.  

尤其是现在阶级固化、岗位固化，“龙生龙凤生凤”，底层难以突破的今天，悲剧还在不断制造。  
Especially nowadays, with class and job solidification, where the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, and it seems that those at the bottom have no chance to break through, tragedies are constantly being created.  

那么原生家庭还有理由说什么？怪罪原生家庭是找对根子了。  
So what excuse can the original family have? Blaming the original family is hitting the nail on the head.
