为什么人会对蟑螂如此厌恶但其他大型昆虫就不会？

Why do humans loathe cockroaches so much yet feel no such disgust toward other large insects?

---
绝大多数虫子并不能感知到人类的存在，它们不知道什么是人类，也许只知道一团巨大的阴影，也许连这个也不知道，他们本能的吃，本能的喝，本能的趋光，本能的繁衍，然后死去。

The vast majority of insects cannot perceive human existence at all. They have no idea what a human is—perhaps they only register a large shadow, or maybe not even that. They eat on instinct, drink on instinct, move toward light on instinct, reproduce on instinct, and then die.

---
苍蝇蚊子马蜂会进攻和骚扰人类，但它们对人类没有概念，更像是本能驱动的僵尸一般；

Flies, mosquitoes and wasps will attack and pester humans, yet they have no concept of what a human is. They are more like zombies driven purely by instinct.

---
蟑螂不是。

Cockroaches are different.

---
蟑螂住在你家里。蟑螂是你的室友。蟑螂知道你是谁。

Cockroaches live in your home. They are your roommates. They know who you are.

---
蟑螂有你的电话号码。

They even know your phone number.

---
它知道你几点睡觉，几点起床。它知道你住在哪个房间，它知道你在哪里做饭。

They know what time you go to bed and what time you get up. They know which room you sleep in and where you cook your meals.

---
它知道你养了什么宠物。偶尔还会逗逗它们。

They know what pets you keep—and sometimes even tease them a little.

---
它知道吃的放在哪里，它不打扰你，它会自己去拿。

They know where you keep the food. They never bother you; they just help themselves quietly.

---
你有客人来的时候它会少出来转悠，它知道自己生的丑陋。

They come out less often when you have guests over, for they know they are not a pretty sight.

---
它有礼貌。它尽量不侵犯你的空间，没什么重要的事尽量不去卧室打搅你。客厅也很少来。它对你保持表面上的尊重。

They are polite. They try their best not to intrude on your space. Unless it’s something important, they never bother you in the bedroom, and they rarely show up in the living room either. They maintain a superficial sense of respect toward you.

---
你吃饭的时候它从来不会爬上你的桌子，尽管它很爱吃你做的菜。

They never crawl onto your dining table while you’re eating, even though they absolutely love the food you cook.

---
蟑螂知道你讨厌它。蟑螂什么都知道。

Cockroaches know you detest them. They know everything.

---
它尽量脚步轻轻的不吵醒你。

They move as quietly as they can, so as not to wake you up.

---
如果哪天你违背了生物钟，你午夜闯入了厨房，开了灯，你打扰到了它正常的作息，打断了它和家人们快乐的活动时间，它也不会恼怒来攻击你。

If one day you go against your own biological clock, sneak into the kitchen at midnight and turn on the light—disturbing their daily routine and cutting short their happy time with family—they won’t get angry and attack you.

---
它会对此感到慌乱，惶恐。虽然可能慌不择路，但它想尽快隐藏身形，它知道你是主人，它是卑微的借宿者。

Instead, they will panic and feel terrified. They may scurry around aimlessly in their haste, but all they want is to hide as quickly as possible. For they know you are the master, and they are just lowly uninvited guests.

---
它感到了羞愧。而你厌恶的正是这一点。

They feel ashamed. And that, precisely, is what you find so repellent about them.
