为什么感觉身边的女生思维都非常浅薄？

Why do I feel that the girls around me have very shallow thinking?

不要责备她们

Don’t blame them.

---
女生，尤其是具备一定姿色的女生，她们一生的玩法就像在泳池里玩跳跳乐，她们不需要会游泳，她们只要选择自己能够到了，看上去最稳的那块泡沫板就行。

Girls, especially those with certain good looks, live their lives like playing hopscotch in a swimming pool. They don’t need to know how to swim—they just need to choose the most stable-looking foam board that they can reach.

---
有时候情况比较麻烦，面前的泡沫板都在往下沉，那么挑一个沉的慢的，先踩上去再考虑下一步。

Sometimes things get tricky: all the foam boards in front of them are sinking. Then they’ll pick the one that sinks the slowest, step on it first, and then think about the next move.

并不是她们浅薄，而是她们和你的人生路径不一样。

It’s not that they’re shallow, but that their life path is different from yours.

---
你需要的是在水里游泳，那么水深水浅你肯定要懂，而她们不需要关心这些。

You need to swim in the water, so you definitely have to understand how deep or shallow it is—but they don’t need to care about that.

---
这是没有高下之分的，也许你研究了很久如何游泳，但是还是不小心抽筋了淹死了，而她很幸运地踩上一块结实的泡沫板，滑着滑着就上岸了。

There’s no hierarchy here. Maybe you’ve studied how to swim for a long time, but you still accidentally cramped up and drowned. Meanwhile, she was lucky enough to step on a sturdy foam board and slide her way to the shore.

多关注自己，少评论他人。

Focus more on yourself and comment less on others.
