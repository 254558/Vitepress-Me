# 中国为什么会诞生出那么多高认知的穷人？
中国为什么会诞生出那么多高认知的穷人？

Why have so many highly literate yet impoverished people emerged in China?

---
你是一只鸡。

You are a chicken.

---
你自觉的你有别于其他的鸡，

You firmly believe you are different from the others,

---
你觉得自己开智了。

convinced that you have attained enlightenment.

---
于是，

And so,

---
你秀优越，

you flaunt your supposed superiority,

---
诗词歌赋、利维坦、社会学，

name-dropping poetry, *Leviathan*, and sociology,

---
但没有鸡搭理你。

yet not a single chicken pays you any mind.

---
母鸡们更是对你不屑一顾。

The hens, in particular, disdain you outright.

---
你天天焦虑，

You live in constant anxiety,

---
你天天咒骂其他的麻木的鸡，

cursing the other chickens for their supposed ignorance day in and day out,

---
你开始筹划大计，

you start hatching grand plans,

---
为了众鸡的未来而担忧、

worrying about the future of your fellow chickens—

---
没准还付诸了行动。

and perhaps even taking action to that end.

---
终于，

Then, at long last,

---
在别的鸡吃吃喝喝中，

while the other chickens are eating and drinking their fill,

---
在你天天焦虑中，

and you are trapped in your endless anxiety,

---
那天到了。

that day arrives.

---
笼子打开了，

The cage door swings open,

---
刀来了。

and the knife comes.

---
你使劲鸣叫、扑腾，

You squawk and flutter with all your might,

---
呼唤那些你觉得麻木的鸡，

calling out to the chickens you deemed ignorant,

---
可那刀、不动分毫。

yet the knife does not waver in the slightest.

---
径直抹向了你的脖子。

It slices cleanly across your neck.

---
于是，

And then,

---
整个世界安静了。

the world falls silent.

---
嗯，

Hmm.

---
世界只是少了个会思考、

The world has merely lost one chicken that thought it could think—

---
或者说自以为是的鸡而已。

or rather, one chicken that was full of its own self-importance.

---
没有任何损失和改变。

No loss, no change at all.

---
一个道理。

The same logic applies.

---
这只鸡再高知，

No matter how "knowledgeable" this chicken was,

---
它诞生的时候，

from the moment it came into being,

---
牢笼和那把刀，

the cage and the knife

---
已经注定了。

were already its inescapable fate.

---
太难了。真的太难了。

It’s hopeless. Truly hopeless.

---
这就是所谓的命运。

This is what we call destiny.

---
什么是命运？

What is destiny, anyway?

---
摆好了、注定的、体系，仅此而已。

It is nothing more than a preordained, rigged system.

---
那么，

So then,

---
我的朋友，我的鸡，

my friend, my fellow chicken,

---
两个问题：

I have two questions for you:

---
你是真开智了吗？还是自以为？

Have you truly attained enlightenment, or is it all just in your head?

---
当得知命运，你还决定开智吗？

If you had known your fate from the start, would you still have chosen to "enlighten" yourself?
