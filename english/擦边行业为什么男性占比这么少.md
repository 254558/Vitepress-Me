擦边行业为什么男性占比这么少？  
Why is the proportion of men in edge industries so low?

经常逛小红书的朋友，应该很熟悉一句话叫：  
Friends who often browse Xiaohongshu should be very familiar with a saying:

---

“帅而不自知”。  
"Being handsome without realizing it."

---

对很大一部分女生来说，这个标准在评判帅哥的时候优先级非常之高，  
For a large number of girls, this criterion has an extremely high priority when evaluating handsome guys.

---

有时候甚至比脸、身材、神态气质这些和帅硬相关的标准还高。  
Sometimes it’s even higher than standards directly related to handsomeness, such as facial features, figure, and temperament.

---

比如：“一个男的只要知道自己帅了就会好下头，哪里能给我一个帅而不自知的男人啊”  
For example: "As long as a guy knows he’s handsome, he becomes such a turn-off. Where can I find a guy who’s handsome without realizing it?"

---

这个标准直觉上是很违背常理的，她们最喜欢最推崇的“大女主”就是充分自知甚至自恋的，那为什么对于帅哥要要求“帅而不自知”呢？  
Intuitively, this standard is quite unreasonable. The "independent heroine" they admire most is fully self-aware, even narcissistic. So why do they demand "being handsome without realizing it" from handsome guys?

---

很简单。  
It’s simple.

---

自身付费意愿和能力双低，只能指望卖家不识货，自己才好趁着市场不规范低价捡漏。  
They have both low willingness and ability to pay. They can only hope that the seller doesn’t know the true value, so they can take advantage of the irregular market to get a bargain at a low price.

---

帅而自知，就会要求女生按照帅的价格付费。女生其实是很讨厌这一点的。  
A guy who knows he’s handsome will ask girls to pay according to his looks. Girls actually hate this very much.
