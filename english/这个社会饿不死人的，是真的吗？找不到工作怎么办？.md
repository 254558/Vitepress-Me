这个社会饿不死人的，是真的吗？找不到工作怎么办？

Is it true that no one will starve to death in this society? What if you can’t find a job?

---
是的。

Yes.

---
当你发烧三十九度五在寒风里骑着电单车送外卖迷迷糊糊被撞飞。

When you have a fever of 39.5 degrees Celsius, riding an electric scooter to deliver food in the biting wind and getting knocked over in a daze.

---
他们说自己才是安全的第一责任人，你死于愚昧。

They say you are the primary person responsible for your own safety, and that you died of ignorance.

---
当你四十多岁干活摔断了胳膊不能上工讨要医药费被推来推去觉得人生了无生趣从天台一跃而下的时候。

When you are in your forties, break your arm at work and can no longer take shifts, get passed around when asking for medical expenses, feel that life is devoid of meaning, and jump off the roof.

---
他们说你死于不懂法。

They say you died of not knowing the law.

---
这个社会，只要你想，完全可以把饿死换成很多其他死法。

In this society, if you want, you can totally replace starvation with many other ways to die.

---
如果你不想，他们说你对社会毫无价值，死得活该。

If you don’t want to, they say you are worthless to society and that you deserved to die.
