中国为什么会诞生出那么多高认知的穷人？

Why have so many highly literate yet impoverished people emerged in China?

假设00年初，背背佳的老总杜国楹找你合作卖背背佳。

Suppose back in the early 2000s, Du Guoying, the CEO of Babaka, came to you with a proposal to collaborate on selling his posture-correcting braces.

---
你看了看产品，说道：“现在的娃驼背主要是缺乏运动以及学业太重，其实很容易改善，你这产品很快就会被发现没有作用，卖不出去的。”

After examining the product, you said, “Kids these days hunch over mainly because they lack exercise and are burdened with too much schoolwork. The problem is actually easy to fix. Your product will soon be exposed as ineffective and won’t sell at all.”

---
结果杜总赚得盆满钵满，你看着他大把数钱把大腿拍肿了。

Yet Du went on to make a fortune. Watching him count stacks of cash, you kicked yourself so hard you could’ve bruised your thigh.

---
过了两年，史玉柱来找你卖脑白金，你看了看产品配料，笑道：“你这不就是加了点普通维生素和氨基酸么，成本这么低还卖这么贵，你当消费者是傻吗？”

Two years later, Shi Yuzhu approached you to sell Naobaijin. After checking the product’s ingredients, you scoffed, “This is just some basic vitamins and amino acids, isn’t it? The production cost is so low, yet you’re selling it at such a steep price. Do you take consumers for fools?”

---
结果史玉柱赚得盆满钵满，你气得吐出几两血，欲哭无泪。

But Shi also raked in huge profits. You were so furious you felt like coughing up blood, stuck between anger and despair with no tears left to shed.

---
2015年，杜总又来找你卖小罐茶，你吸取教训没有当场驳斥他，认真听他娓娓道来商业方案。

In 2015, Du came to you again, this time to promote Xiaoguan Tea. Having learned your lesson, you didn’t contradict him outright; instead, you listened carefully as he laid out his business plan in detail.

---
听到他说八个炒茶大师亲手制作，你终于忍不住了，冷笑道：“杜总，之前背背佳算我走眼，但是这小罐茶你说八个大师亲手制作，合着八个大师人均一天炒一吨茶么？那手不得抡残疾了，消费者再傻，他们家里总该有计算器吧？一算不就算出来了吗？再说了，茶叶现在是过度饱和行业，竞争太激烈，你这项目我不看好。”

When he claimed that the tea was hand-roasted by eight master tea roasters, you finally couldn’t hold back. You sneered, “Mr. Du, I’ll admit I misjudged Babaka back then. But with this Xiaoguan Tea—you say it’s hand-roasted by eight masters? Does that mean each of them roasts a ton of tea leaves a day? Their hands would be crippled from all that stirring! Even if consumers are naive, they must have calculators at home, right? A simple calculation would expose this claim! Besides, the tea market is already oversaturated with cutthroat competition. I’m not optimistic about this project at all.”

---
结果杜总再次赚得日进斗金，这次你没有难过与悔恨，而是发出了不甘的咆哮：“原来世界上真有这么多傻叉呀！我靠！”

But once again, Du made a killing. This time, instead of wallowing in sadness or regret, you let out a roar of bitter frustration: “So there really are this many idiots in the world! Damn it!”

---
随即，你突然沉默了片刻，喃喃道：“不，我才是天底下最大的大傻叉！”

Right after that, you fell silent for a moment, then muttered to yourself, “No... I’m the biggest idiot of them all.”
