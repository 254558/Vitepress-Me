我老婆让我结扎，我不想做该怎么办？

My wife wants me to get a vasectomy, but I’m unwilling to do it—what should I do?

---
女人的众多双标行为模式中的一个典型范例

This is a classic example of women’s many double-standard behavioral patterns

---
只说【你将来可能会怎么怎么样，所以你要给她一个什么什么保障】

She’ll only talk about “what might happen to you in the future, so you have to give her some kind of guarantee”

---
却闭口不提【她将来可能会怎么怎么样，所以她要给你一个什么什么保障】

but never mentions a word about “what might happen to her in the future, so she should give you some kind of guarantee”

---
而这种行为一旦发生，后续其实也就这么几种：

Once this kind of situation arises, there are basically only a few possible follow-up scenarios:

---
1、不得不说这种双标隐藏的真的很深

1. It has to be said that this kind of double standard is extremely well hidden

---
大部分男人不具备看懂这种双标的智力基础

Most men lack the ability to see through it

---
只能隐隐觉得有点不对，但又说不上具体不对在哪儿

they can only vaguely sense that something is off, but can’t put their finger on exactly what

---
于是稀里糊涂的就服从了

In the end, they meekly comply in a muddle

---
被对方无中生有的造了一张牌，白嫖一票

letting their partner create an unwarranted demand out of thin air and gain an unfair advantage for free

---
2、男人看穿了这种双标，反问“那你也可能XXX，你怎么不XXX？”

2. The man sees through the double standard and retorts, “Then you might also XXX—why don’t you do XXX?”

---
女方开始“那我XXX呀，而且XXX呀，你又不XXX，怎么能说是XXX呢”

His wife then starts rambling: “But I do XXX! Besides, XXX! You don’t even do XXX—how can you call this XXX?”

---
双方开始漫长的盘逻辑互相挑刺抬杠环节

The two then embark on a long, drawn-out battle of nitpicking and bickering over logic

---
从塔拉夏的古墓一直扯到黄金树大教堂

arguing about everything under the sun—from the Tomb of Tal Rasha to the Erdtree Cathedral

---
最后以双方体力不支，开始闹别扭收尾

The fight ends with both sides exhausted and upset with each other

---
虽然最终你没有被驯化和白嫖

Though you avoid being manipulated and taken advantage of in the end

---
但也落得一身疲惫，还得去哄

you’re left utterly drained, still have to go and appease her

---
以及这个雷并没有彻底被排掉

and the underlying issue remains unresolved like an unexploded bomb

---
那么办法呢？没什么好办法

So what’s the solution? There really isn’t a good one

---
对于1这类人，放弃吧，硬件不支持跑复杂软件

For men in category 1—just give up. They lack the mental capacity to navigate such complex situations

---
遇到了就是遇到了

when they encounter this kind of problem, they’re stuck with it

---
对于2这类人，具备看穿的能力，那就谨慎

For men in category 2 who can see through the double standard—the only thing to do is be cautious

---
既然遇到了没什么好办法，那最好的办法就是尽量不遇到

Since there’s no good fix once you’re in this situation, the best strategy is to avoid it altogether

---
只能说，在择偶的时候尽量多看多选多比较

All you can do is take your time to meet, compare and evaluate more people when choosing a partner

---
谨慎点儿，找个行为模式里不带这种地雷的人再进入婚姻

Be prudent, and only enter a marriage with someone whose behavioral patterns don’t contain such hidden landmines
