为什么很多女人叫老公“队友”?

Why do so many women call their husbands "teammates"?

让老公履行作为丈夫的义务，但自己不愿意承认是其妻子的委婉说法。

It is a euphemism for forcing one’s husband to fulfill his marital obligations while refusing to acknowledge her own role as a wife.

因为夫妻是有道德义务的，但是队友没有，简单来说就是“低道德优势”的具象化。

Because spouses are bound by moral obligations, whereas teammates are not. Simply put, it is the embodiment of the so-called "low-morality advantage".
